Binding Free Energy Estimator 2
=================================

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

Binding free energy estimator (BFEE) is a python-based software that automates absolute binding free energy calculations through either the alchemical or geometric route by molecular dynamics simulations.

Theoretical backgrounds
-----------------------

The degrees of freedom of the protein-ligand (or host-guest) system are described by a series of geometric variables (or collective variables), as firstly described by the `Karplus group`_. In BFEE, a generalized, best-fit-rotation-based geometric variables are used, making it in principle available to any protein-ligand complex. See `this paper`_ for introduction of these variables.

In the `geometric route`_, the degrees of freedom is investigated one by one, through one-dimensional free-energy calculations. In BFEE, `WTM-eABF`_ is used, while other importance-sampling algorithms such as `plain eABF`_ are also acceptable. The `alchemical route`_ is a variants of the double `decoupling method (DDM)`_. A thermodynamic cycle, in which the ligand and the geometric restraints are decoupled independently to guarantee the convergence of the simulations.

Features
--------

- Generates all the input files for absolute binding free energy calculations;
- Perform post-treatment automatedly;
- Support NAMD (alchemical and geometric route) and Gromacs (geometric route) as molecular dynamics engines;
- Support many file formats for the input complex structure (PSF/PDB/PRM, PRM7/RST7, TOP/PDB);
- ...

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.6+, PySide 2, numpy, matplotlib and MDAnalysis.
- NAMD 3.0 or later / Colvars patched Gromacs.

Installation
------------

We suggest to install BFEE2 through conda. It will be safe if conda is install in a new environment.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create --name bfee   (optional)
    conda activate bfee        (optional)
    conda install -c conda-forge BFEE2

Usage
-----

Simply run BFEE2Gui.py in terminal or PowerShell. One may need to use the absolute path on MS Windows.
