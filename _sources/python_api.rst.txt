Python API
=============

BFEE2 Python API provides information for the end-user to use BFEE2 in a console program / streamline.

One may always use **BFEE2.inputGenerator** and **BFEE2.postTreatment** when using BFEE2 Python API in automated/streamlined binding free-energy calculation.
If one wants to use BFEE2 as an NAMD or Colvars parser, **BFEE2.templates_namd** also deserves to look at.

See BFEE2 user guide if one wants to know how to use BFEE2.
